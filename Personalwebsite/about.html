        <em><h2>Educational Goals</h2></em>
        <p> I am planning on working hard to understand and effectvly apply the skills, that I'm looking forward to learning in the immersive to break into the Tech industry. I am excited to learn new technologies starting with web design and development.
            This would give me a baseline of knowledge to become a contributing member of a good team of programmers. </p>
        <em><h2>Career Goals</h2></em>
        <p> I have spent more than 2/3 of my time in the workforce self employed. The new opportunity of developing my own software for business use is very intriguing to me. I have been a consultant for business needs in many aspects and I would like to
            establish an avenue to put my new skills to use. Consulting would give me the freedom and flexibility that I've grown to like.</p>
